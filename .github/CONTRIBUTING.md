# Contributing to My Portfolio Website

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

This is my personal portfolio website. It is primarily my own project, so contributions are **only welcome if absolutely necessary**. Minor suggestions or cosmetic changes may not be merged.

## Guidelines for Contributing

1. **Check Before Contributing**  
   Please make sure your contribution is essential. If it’s not a critical fix or major improvement, it’s likely best to leave it as-is.

2. **Bug Fixes**  
   - Clearly describe the bug.  
   - Include steps to reproduce it.  
   - Provide a tested solution if possible.

3. **Feature Requests**  
   - Only propose features that are essential or significantly improve the project.  
   - Include a clear explanation of why the feature is necessary.

4. **Pull Requests**  
   - Keep PRs small and focused.  
   - Follow the existing code style.  
   - Include tests/documentation if applicable.  

5. **Communication**  
   - Be respectful and constructive.  
   - Understand that not all contributions may be accepted.
