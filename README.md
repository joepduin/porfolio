# Portfolio

Personal website of Joep Duin — a simple, static portfolio site built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

## About
This repository contains my personal website/portfolio with information about me, projects, and contact details. The site is lightweight, responsive, and focused on a clean presentation of work and ways to get in touch.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS (majority of styling)
- JavaScript (small interactive elements)

## Project structure
- `index.html` — main entry page
- `css/` — styles and layout files
- `js/` — JavaScript for interactive parts
- `assets/` — images and other media

(Exact folder names may vary — check the repository for the current file structure.)

## Install & run locally
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/joepduin/porfolio.git
2. Change into the project directory:
   cd porfolio
3. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server for better testing:
   - With VS Code: use the Live Server extension
   - With Python 3:
     python -m http.server 8000
   - Then visit: http://localhost:8000

## Development
- Edit HTML and CSS files to update content and styling.
- Add or modify small interactions in the JS files.
- Use a modern browser while developing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Deploy
You can host the site on GitHub Pages:
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages.
2. Select the branch (e.g., `main`) and the root (`/`) as the source.
3. Save; the site will be available at `https://joepduin.github.io/porfolio/` or the URL assigned by GitHub.
